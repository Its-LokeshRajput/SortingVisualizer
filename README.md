# Sorting Visualizer

This project is a **Sorting Visualizer** built using pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It provides an interactive way to visualize how different sorting algorithms work by visualizing the steps taken by the algorithms to sort an array.

## Features
- **Algorithms Supported**: 
  - Bubble Sort
  - Selection Sort
  - Insertion Sort
- **Visual Representation**: 
  - The array is represented as bars, and their heights represent the values of the array.
  - Each step of the sorting process is visually displayed to make the sorting mechanism easier to understand.
- **Interactive Controls**: 
  - Choose the sorting algorithm and speed of execution.
  - Step through the sorting process manually or let the visualization run automatically.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5** for structuring the web page
- **CSS3** for styling and animations
- **JavaScript** for implementing sorting algorithms and controlling the animation flow

## Getting Started
